    <h1>Welcome To Dead Deer Co-housing Community</h1>

    The fruit you buy in the grocery story has so much sugar in it now that it causes weight gain and tooth decay in zoo animals.<a href="https://weather.com/news/news/2018-10-03-fruit-so-sweet-zoo-stopped-feeding-them-to-animals">[1]</a>  High sugar content isn't the only reason your teeth might be aching though, or your organs or joints for that matter, or why you might have brain fog or low concentration.  The modern diet is also heavily mineral and vitamin deficient.  Vegetables have lost around 20% of key nutrient levels.  <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/soil-depletion-and-nutrition-loss/">[2]</a>  fruit is only sugar.  Vegetables are only water.  And meat is full of cheap grain and torment.  Grocery stores are designed and optimized to wear you out so they can hijack you foraging instincts.  And it's all getting more expensive by the day.

	I believe most of the suffering that afflicts modern man is a result of the the disconnect between the environment he has evolved to thrive in and the environment we have.  And one of the primary ways this manifests along with meals is through the lack of community.  I've traveled the world and found that the happiest people are the ones who live simple lives in nature surrounded by simple caring people.

	<h3>Political Structure</h3>
	The political structure of the community will work like this until a better one is defined:  There are two titles in the community.  Member and "Village Elder".  Village Elders are also members.  Village Elders are elected by vote.  Each member over the age of 16 can cast as many votes as they want, one per candidate, and cannot vote for themselves.  All members are automatically candidates.  The number of Village Elders is one fifth of the population of the community rounded down to the next odd number up to five.  The term of Village Elder only last three months before another election is held.  The Village Elder's authority is in that they have the power to evict a community member from the property by the force of the police and to banish a member on a majority vote.  A member of the community that is banished or that decided to leave is able to cash out on the accumulated value of all community assets logged in the ledger based on the percentage invested.  This means that if a community member has invested $100 dollars into the community, and at the time of departure the total value of all assets has increased by 2%, that individual can expect to be paid back $102.  The appraisal of community assets is determined by a professional appraiser outside the community.  The cash out is payed out in installments proposed by the Village Elders at a minimum of $2,000 dollars a month adjusted for inflation as of 2024 or whatever is left owed whichever is less.  The ledger is publicly visible.  The community elders can vote to strike an item from the ledger but only before the money is spent as long as they are given notice of the investment before it is made or if the payment is canceled.  If they are not give notice they can strike the item up to one week after it was added.  Stationary dwelling units are property of the community and so should be invested in through the ledger but mobile ones can be private and taken with a person when they leave.  The Village Elders cannot spend money from the community fund.  They can only propose purchases which must be approved by at least a 3 to 2 vote from all community members over the age of 23.  The point is that weather you are buying toilet paper to be used in communal space or you are paying for upgrades to the sewage system or simply paying your portion of the property tax, you are investing in the community, and you should be able to do so with the knowledge that you are not risking your hard earned money on an investment that could be taken from you for whatever reason.  Assets donated can count as investments and are appraised at the average amount given them by Village Elders but labor cannot.  Anyone member of the community who does work for the community as anything other than an act of service should be hired and payed in legal tender.    Rare items like books or antiques that will be left in community space but not donated should be logged if the owner wants to take them with them when they leave.  The community can never exceed 150 members.

	Every month of rent that is paid to a landlord is a paycheck gone forever.  Money that can never be spent on retirement or travel or to start a business or to send you children to college or for a down payment on your own home.  To rent a $1,800 apartment for 10 years is to simply give away $216,000 to live somewhere in which you have very little control over how your environment is structured.
